Andrei's PL/SQL cleaner. 
Run steps:
- Add your SQL code to "add_your_sql_here.sql".
- The bat file may be considered unsafe. If so, rightclick it, go to properties, unblock it.
- Considering you have python installed, run .bat file "run_me.bat". This will just run the command "py plsql_cleaner.py" for you.
- Your new cleaned code is now in clean_sql.sql
- NOTES: Comments inbetween PL/SQL blocks are not visible in the final clean_sql code.
